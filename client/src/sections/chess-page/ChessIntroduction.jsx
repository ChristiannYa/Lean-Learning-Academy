      <h2>What is Chess?</h2>
      <p>
        Chess is more than a game—it&apos;s a battle of minds. Originating in India,
        it has symbolized epic conflicts for centuries: light vs. shadow, day
        vs. night, strategy vs. instinct. The ultimate goal? Checkmate—an
        ancient Arabic term meaning &apos;the king is dead.&apos; Outsmart your opponent,
        seize control, and claim victory!
