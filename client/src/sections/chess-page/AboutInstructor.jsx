          I started playing chess in July 2024, and from the very first game, I
          was hooked. As someone who thrives on competition, I quickly realized
          that chess is more than just a gameâ€”it&apos;s a battle of strategy,
          patience, and deep thinking. The beauty of chess is that it constantly
          challenges you to improve, adapt, and analyze every move. Beyond that,
          it introduces you to incredible people who share a passion for
          learning and strategy. If you want to sharpen your mind or dive deeper
          into the game, I&apos;m here to help you grow and improve every step
          of the way.
